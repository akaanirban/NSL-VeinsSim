### This is the simulation config files for Veins framework on OMNET++ 4.6

### TODO:
1. Right now , generating 10 random RSU a hotspot by generating 10 random numbers in python. 
2. Need to make this automatic somehow
3. RSUs are still generated at the top left. Need to take care of that.
4. Need to make sure of the transmitting pattern of the nodes. Right now they are voluntarily broadcasting every second.
5. Need to adjust the transmission power.
